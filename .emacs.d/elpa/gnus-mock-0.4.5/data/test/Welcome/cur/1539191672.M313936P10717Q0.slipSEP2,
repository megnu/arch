Welcome to Gnus mock, a trashable, restorable testing environment for
Gnus.  Everything you do to this environment will be temporary, and you
can wipe the slate clean by killing this Emacs process and calling M-x
gnus-mock-start again, from your main Emacs process.

You can also call M-x gnus-mock-reload at any time to shut down Gnus and
replace the original data.  Depending on what you've done to Gnus in the
meantime, however, this might not fully restore a clean environment.

All messages sent from this Gnus installation will end up in the
"incoming" mailbox of the "Test" nnmaildir server.

Email Eric at eric@ericabrahamsen.net with bug reports and suggestions
(don't email me from here, obviously!).

Yours,
Eric
