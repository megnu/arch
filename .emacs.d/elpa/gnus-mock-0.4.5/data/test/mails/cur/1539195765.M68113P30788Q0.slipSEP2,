Make sure you talk to Gerd to get you on the mailing list that he's
created for people with write access to the repository.  Otherwise,
here's the spiel:

Hello and welcome to Subversions, the GNU CVS server with an incredibly
clever name.

In order to give you access, I will need 2 things from you:

1) Your prefered username.

2) The method by which you will access your repository.  We support 3
methods right now:

i) Kerberos
ii) pserver
iii) lsh

If you would like to use Kerberos to access, I need to arrange to send
you your password.  A good way of doing this is to send me a GnuPG key.
If this is difficult, I can postal mail the password to you, or arrange
to be near a phone at a particular time to give it to you.  If you have a
`GNU.ORG' kerberos account already, please just send me the name.

If you would like to use pserver, please send me your password encoded with
`crypt'.

If you would like to use lsh, please send me your DSA key.  Sadly, I haven't
gotten OpenSSH DSA keys to work yet.  If you know how to do this, please
let me know.

These instructions are intentionally brief.  If you need the detailed
version or have any questions, please let me know.

Please send any correspondance to cvs-hackers@gnu.org
