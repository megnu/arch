"cvs login" (:pserver) and "cvs update" are extraordinarily slow.
is this okay?

this page claims that I can use SSH.
I will have to put .ssh/identity.pub into subversions:~sds, right?
how do I do this?

-----------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
# change the CVS Root
# usage:
# cd /usr/local/src/emacs
# find . -type d -name CVS -exec chcvsroot {} \;

ROOTO="anoncvs.gnu.org:/gd/gnu/cvsroot";
ROOT="subversions.gnu.org:/cvs";
REPOO="/gd/gnu/cvsroot";
REPO="/cvs";

FF=$1;
echo " - "${FF}
sed "s?${ROOTO}?${ROOT}?" ${FF}/Root > ${FF}.tmp
mv ${FF}.tmp ${FF}/Root
sed "s?${REPOO}?${REPO}?" ${FF}/Repository > ${FF}.tmp
mv ${FF}.tmp ${FF}/Repository

Thanks.
