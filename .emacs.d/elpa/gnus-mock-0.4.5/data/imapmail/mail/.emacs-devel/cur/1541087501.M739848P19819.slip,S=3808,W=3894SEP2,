Ah, okay.  Thanks, should be fixed now.

(Btw zero is not valid as the value of display-line-number-width,
although the code before the last changes mistakenly tried using it.
Starting from now, zero and any other non-positive value are
interpreted as nil.)

Yes.  The initial naïve implementation was unbearably slow, but I was
lucky to find a shortcut.  It is still sometimes slow, and a few
redisplay optimizations are disabled with this mode, because moving
point vertically needs to redisplay the entire window, since the line
numbers change.  If someone has ideas for speeding it up, I'm all
ears.

At least it is significantly faster than the only add-on package which
implemented something similar to visual mode.
